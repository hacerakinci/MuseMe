DantoWILLCHANGE Jonathan Professor Emeritus of PhilosophyWILLCHANGE Columbia UniversityWILLCHANGE and art criticWILLCHANGE The Nation. In this lecture recorded on September 19WILLCHANGE 1993WILLCHANGE at the National Gallery of ArtWILLCHANGE Arthur C. Danto assesses early works in Pablo Picasso's (1881-973) career as a starting point for considering the concept of the masterpiece. The understandable but obsessive tendency of Picasso scholarship has been to treat even his simplest works as evidence that his cognitive powers had almost mythic dimensions. Danto argues that much of Picasso's early work became part of history only retrospectively because he became a great artist- mythic a priori. An artist makes certain choices in materials when he believes himself to be embarking on a masterpiece. By investing in a large-scale canvasWILLCHANGE its liningWILLCHANGE and other expensive materials for a paintingWILLCHANGE an artist demonstrates the meaning this particular work intended to have relative to his other works so far. It is a conservation gesture-not part of the internal or aesthetic meaning of the workWILLCHANGE but a declaration of achievement and hope. Citing Picasso's rose period work Family of <i>Saltimbanques</i> (1905)WILLCHANGE in the Gallery's collectionWILLCHANGE and the African-influenced period work <i>Les Demoiselles d'Avignon</i> (1907)WILLCHANGE Danto considers the meaning of a masterpiece in an artist's life in terms of the language of beginnings and endings.

In responseWILLCHANGE David Driskell presented a lecture at the Gallery on February 11WILLCHANGE 1990WILLCHANGE on multi-cultural representation in art museum collections and exhibitions and among staff and visitors.

The artistWILLCHANGE nÃ©e Ursula KaroliszynWILLCHANGE was born in 1942 in DeensenWILLCHANGE a small German town where her Polish-speaking Ukrainian father was conscripted by the Nazis to work the land during World War II. The family remained there until the end of the warWILLCHANGE and then moved through nine camps for displaced persons in five years. After immigrating to the United States at age eightWILLCHANGE von Rydingsvard and her family carved out a new life for themselves. She earned an MFA from Columbia University in 1975WILLCHANGE and emerged from her studies focused on the cedar 4 Ã 4 beams that would define her sculptural practice. Although her work is abstractWILLCHANGE the artist has acknowledged a strong correlation to the human figure. This link is most visible in her vertically oriented conical worksWILLCHANGE exemplified by <i>Five Cones</i> (1990–1992)WILLCHANGE which was donated to the National Gallery of Art by Sherry and Joel Mallin in 2011. The gridlike format and the organic flow of von Rydingsvard’s materials give Five Cones its structural and visual tensions. It is this compromise formation—the artist’s physical aggression toward her material together with the considerable refinement of form—that gives strength to von Rydingsvard’s work.

Gorky thinned his paint with turpentine and might have applied it with a turkey baster. Overall green and brown hues suggest a landscapeWILLCHANGE but there are no identifiable landscape forms and no spatial recession.

In this paintingWILLCHANGE the boldWILLCHANGE animated lines against a white ground capture Mitchell’s spontaneous and impulsive painting method.

283657980;audio; Fresh WidowWILLCHANGE Duchamp  ; <p><i>Fresh Widow</i> is one of Duchamp’s “readymades”—commonplace objects that the artist signed and then exhibited as art. Working with a dealer in 1964WILLCHANGE Duchamp oversaw the production of eight reproductions of his original <i>Fresh Widow</i>WILLCHANGE of which this is the second.

283658408;audio; Bird in SpaceWILLCHANGE Brancusi  ; <p>While this sculpture might seem abstractWILLCHANGE Brancusi insisted that his works revealed the inner essence of his subjects.

283658792;audio; Tableau No. IV; Lozenge Composition with RedWILLCHANGE GrayWILLCHANGE BlueWILLCHANGE YellowWILLCHANGE and BlackWILLCHANGE Mondrian   ; <p>Though totally abstractWILLCHANGE Mondrian’s “neo-plastic” paintings attempt to capture the complex equilibrium found in nature. The reduced color palette and stark opposition of black vertical and horizontal lines against blocks of white and primary colors were meant to spiritually represent natural harmony. This was the first neo-plastic painting to be created in the lozengeWILLCHANGE or diamondWILLCHANGE format.</p> 
283659595;audio; FaÃ§ades d’immeubles (Building FaÃ§ades)WILLCHANGE Dubuffet    ; <p>The rough textureWILLCHANGE somber color paletteWILLCHANGE and coarse style of Dubuffet’s paintings confront the viewer with their directness. In this workWILLCHANGE he depicts a city in a graffiti-like figurative style. He created the animatedWILLCHANGE crudely drawn stick figures of this postwar apartment complex by scratching through black paint to reveal hiddenWILLCHANGE delicate colors beneath.</p> 
283659755;audio; One Year the MilkweedWILLCHANGE Gorky    ; <p>This is one of several so-called color veil paintings Gorky made in 1944WILLCHANGE in which films of paint have been washed unevenly across the canvas and evocative but indistinct forms have been brushed in. Gorky thinned his paint with turpentine and might have applied it with a turkey baster. Overall green and brown hues suggest a landscapeWILLCHANGE but there are no identifiable landscape forms and no spatial recession. InsteadWILLCHANGE vertical drips and the alternation of light and deep tones create a shiftingWILLCHANGE shimmering effect across the surface of the canvas.</p> 
283659952;audio; Number 1WILLCHANGE 1950 (Lavender Mist)WILLCHANGE Pollock    ; <p>Pollock’s drip painting technique was instrumental in the development of action paintingWILLCHANGE one method of the abstract expressionist style. Abstract expressionist painters sought to create works that evoked pure emotion from the viewer. In this pieceWILLCHANGE splashing linesWILLCHANGE puddlesWILLCHANGE and drips create multiple layers that suggest energy and depth. The result seems spontaneous yet controlledWILLCHANGE intuitive yet thoughtfully considered.</p> 
283660228;audio; Piano mÃ©caniqueWILLCHANGE Mitchell  ; <p>Mitchell was a leading figure in the group of artists known as the second generation of abstract expressionists. In this paintingWILLCHANGE the boldWILLCHANGE animated lines against a white ground capture Mitchell’s spontaneous and impulsive painting method. She often drew upon childhood memories of Lake Michigan when composing paintingsWILLCHANGE some of which she called “expressionist landscapes.” Because they are totally abstractWILLCHANGE the viewer is invited to connect to her works on an emotional level.</p> 
283660457;audio; Beta KappaWILLCHANGE Louis  ; <p>Louis was a leader of the local Washington Color SchoolWILLCHANGE a branch of the larger color field movement. He is best known for experimenting with a process called stainingWILLCHANGE in which he diluted acrylic paints and poured them onto unprimed canvas. He then tippedWILLCHANGE bentWILLCHANGE or folded the canvas or its support to control how the color moved over the surface.</p> 
283660610;audio; Look MickeyWILLCHANGE Lichtenstein  ; <p>This painting was the first for which Lichtenstein borrowed an image directly from popular culture: a children’s book called <i>Donald Duck: Lost and Found</i>. He began this work by making a sketch from his source and then recomposing the image for narrative and formal purposes. He traced the drawing onto a canvasWILLCHANGE making more adjustmentsWILLCHANGE and then painted the dots using a perforated metal screen as a stencilWILLCHANGE imitating industrial printing techniques. Lichtenstein would later refer to this work as his first pop art painting.</p> 
283660789;audio; UntitledWILLCHANGE Judd  ; <p>This piece was created during a crucial turning-point in Judd’s careerWILLCHANGE when he moved from painting to overseeing the construction of large but simple three-dimensional objects. This piece sits on the ground without a pedestalWILLCHANGE directly in the space of the viewerWILLCHANGE and is unframed and exposed in a way that almost no previous sculpture had been. Judd took aim at what he saw as the continuing illusionism of European modernismWILLCHANGE pursuing instead a purely lucid form that would exist simply as an object.</p> 
283660975;audio; Test Piece for “ContingentWILLCHANGE” Hesse   ; <p>This work was one of several studies for the final pieceWILLCHANGE which is comprised of eight similar banners that now hang in the National Gallery of Australia.

Paik pioneered the use of new mediaWILLCHANGE including videoWILLCHANGE in art. For this workWILLCHANGE Paik altered a 19th-century Japanese scroll by adding his handprint and placing a flashing red light behind it. The juxtaposition of a traditional art form with modern technology would become a hallmark of Paik’s work.</p> 
283661354;audio; First StationWILLCHANGE Newman   ; <p>This painting is the first of 14 abstract representations of the Stations of the CrossWILLCHANGE and it is also the first work to feature Newman’s signature “zips.” These vertical elementsWILLCHANGE which could be sharply or loosely definedWILLCHANGE were used to punctuate the single-hued fields of his canvases. This series exemplifies Newman’s efforts to blend abstract expressionism with mystical and spiritual subjects.</p> 
283661498;audio; Double AmericaWILLCHANGE Ligon    ; <p>The top row of letters in this work are painted black and turned toward the wall so the viewer looks at the illuminated backs of the letters. The bottom row depicts the word upside down with the outward facing sides painted blackWILLCHANGE which allows the white neon light to reflect off the wall. This arrangement of skewed perspectives evokes the political turmoil caused by the election of America’s first black president and the country’s contemporaneous involvement in two wars.</p> 
283661659;audio; PALMWILLCHANGE FINGERS & FINGERTIPS (RIGHT HAND) 000394WILLCHANGE Holzer   ; <p>This is one of six silkscreened paintings that show enlarged handprints taken from declassified United States government documents obtained through the Freedom of Information Act. The handprints belong to soldiers accused of detainee abuse in IraqWILLCHANGE and the titles of these pieces are also taken from those documents.</p> 
283661865;audio; TargetWILLCHANGE Johns  ; <p>Johns was known early in his career for returning recognizable objectsWILLCHANGE like targetsWILLCHANGE to the visual arts following the intensely personalWILLCHANGE gestural painting of the abstract expressionists. He presented these familiar items in a coolWILLCHANGE seemingly detachedWILLCHANGE and often enigmatic manner. The tactile quality of his surfaces in works like this one stand out and are a testament to the close relationship Johns perceived between painting and sculpture.</p> 
283662028;audio; Mountains and SeaWILLCHANGE Frankenthaler  ; <p>This work is a perfect example of Frankenthaler’s technique of making pictures entirely by &quot;stainingWILLCHANGE&quot; a process in which she poured thinned paint onto rawWILLCHANGE unprimed canvas. This method results in fields of transparent color that seem to float in spaceWILLCHANGE with the weave of the canvas establishing the flatness of the image. Her arrangement of colors and shapes often evoke the natural environmentWILLCHANGE and each work creates a unique visual space and atmosphere.</p>

The boy in this work was probably inspired by a 15th- or 16th-century German print; he is shown pulling ropesWILLCHANGE perhaps symbolizing his effort to reach for the clouds. To create the backgroundWILLCHANGE Polke stitched together fragments of fabric and dipped the resulting surface in polyester resin. He then poured paint on the back of the work and shifted the canvas to create different shapes. FinallyWILLCHANGE he painted the figure itself. All toldWILLCHANGE this work took Polke a year to complete.</p> 
283662349;audio; Great AmericaWILLCHANGE Marshall  ; <p>This painting reimagines a boat ride into a haunted tunnel at an amusement park as the Middle Passage—the forced journey of slaves from Africa to the Americas. What might in other hands be a work of heavy irony becomes instead a delicate interweaving of the histories of painting and race. The canvasWILLCHANGE which is stretched directly onto the wallWILLCHANGE creates a screen or backdrop onto which viewers project their own associations triggered by the powerful imagery.</p>

In the late 1980s he conceived another seriesWILLCHANGE the <i>Museum PhotographsWILLCHANGE </i>where he photographed in some of the world’s most celebrated museums. These large color picturesWILLCHANGE often depicting crowds of peopleWILLCHANGE explore the different functions that art fulfills in our modernWILLCHANGE secularized world and the ways in which people experience paintings todayWILLCHANGE including the notion of the museum as a sacred pilgrimage site. As his interest in the idea of worship and pilgrimage expandedWILLCHANGE Struth launched a series titled <i>Places of Worship </i>in 1995. In his <i>Family Portraits </i>seriesWILLCHANGE which includes photographs of Struth’s friends as well as of Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of EdinburghWILLCHANGE all the works are infused with a sense of the forces that inform his subjects’ lives.

In this lecture held on October 30WILLCHANGE 2016WILLCHANGE at the National Gallery of ArtWILLCHANGE Kamensky draws from her new book on Copley and his world to untangle the web of principles and interests that shaped the age of America’s founding.

But the artist did not share their politicsWILLCHANGE and painting portraits failed to satisfy his lofty artistic goals. When resistance escalated into all-out warWILLCHANGE Copley was in London. The magisterial canvases he created there—several of which are now in the National Gallery of Art collection—made him one of the towering figures of the British art scene: a painter of America’s Revolution as Britain’s American War. <i>This program is&nbsp;coordinated with and supported by the Smithsonian National&nbsp;Portrait Gallery.</i></p>

American painter Marsden Hartley (1877-1943) entered the modernist canon as a result of the abstract paintings he created in Germany in 1914-1915. But the paintings he created of his home state of Maine late in his career beginning in 1937 brought him his greatest acclaim during his lifetime. In factWILLCHANGE Hartley began his career in 1909 at Alfred Stieglitz’s 291 gallery as a painter of Maine. Previewing a major exhibition to open in March 2017 at the Met Breuer and in July 2017 at the Colby College Museum of ArtWILLCHANGE Randall Griffey illuminates the painter’s dynamicWILLCHANGE richWILLCHANGE and occasionally contradictory artistic engagement with his native Maine.

For the public symposium held on November 19WILLCHANGE 2016WILLCHANGE in conjunction with the exhibition <i>Los Angeles to New York: Dwan GalleryWILLCHANGE 1959 – 1971 </i>at the National Gallery of ArtWILLCHANGE Alex Potts explains how new exhibition spaces and the experimental staging of work at the Ferus Gallery in Los Angeles and Virginia Dwan’s bicoastal galleries gave Edward Kienholz an opportunity in the early and mid-1960s to realize his large-scale tableaux. The powerful effect these works had on the viewer was not just formalWILLCHANGE as in minimalist artWILLCHANGE or simply a result of their often-provocativeWILLCHANGE in-your-face presentationWILLCHANGE but was also related to deep undercurrents of socially and politically charged content. Eventually this set the tableaux at odds with the prevailing climate of the American art world and its increasingly systematic bracketing of a politics of content in favor of a politics of form. Virginia Dwan’s active promotion of some of Kienholz’s more ambitiousWILLCHANGE highly charged tableaux — including <i>The Beanery</i>WILLCHANGE which she showed in 1965WILLCHANGE and the disturbing <i>State Hospital</i>WILLCHANGE shown in her exhibition of his concept tableaux in 1967 — testifies to a particularly rich moment in her take-up of new art. Later Kienholz found himself having to shift the installation of ambitious new work from New York and Los Angeles to venues in Europe.</p>

Roberts of Harvard University explores one of the fundamental operations of printmaking—reversal—in order to trace its impact on American art across a spectrum of media. Behind every print lies a matrix (from the Latin for mother): a plate or block or stone or screen from which the print has been &quot;pulled.&quot; And in most printing processesWILLCHANGE the final print is a reversed version of the matrix. Although reversal may seem at first to be a simple geometrical switching operationWILLCHANGE its material and philosophical complexity is profound; indeedWILLCHANGE one may posit a kind of &quot;negative intelligence&quot; that informs any work of art that deploys reversal. To focus on reversal is to open up new ways of thinking about connections among the fineWILLCHANGE decorativeWILLCHANGE and industrial arts in AmericaWILLCHANGE not least because so many prominent American artists from the 18th through the 20th century had backgrounds in print and printmaking. &quot;Apprenticed as an engraver&quot;; &quot;trained as a lithographer&quot;; &quot;found initial success as a commercial artist&quot;: such are the typical preludes of American artists' biographies. A rigorous analysis of reversal offers an opportunity to expand the adventure of print from the preludes into the main narratives of the stories we tell about American art. The lecture addresses reversal in several contextsWILLCHANGE from the nature prints of Joseph Breintnall in the 1730s to the handprints of Jasper Johns in the 1960sWILLCHANGE with a core focus on the later 19th century in the work of James McNeill Whistler and the American trompe-l'oeil painters.</p>

5189040663001;video; Still Life: Le JourWILLCHANGE Braque (ASL)  ; <p>Braque famously worked alongside Pablo Picasso as the two developed the new style of cubism around 1910. This painting is typical of a later phase in Braque’s careerWILLCHANGE when he incorporated elements of cubism into still lifes and other subjects.

5189040668001;video; Bird in SpaceWILLCHANGE Brancusi (ASL)  ; <p>While this sculpture might seem abstractWILLCHANGE Brancusi insisted that his works revealed the inner essence of his subjects.

HoweverWILLCHANGE this sculpture reflects the artist’s distinctive stylization of the figure with the elongated features and almond-shaped eyes found in many of his paintings. Modigliani focused on sculpture from about 1909 to 1914WILLCHANGE before his death from tuberculosis at age 35 in 1920.</p> 
5189040691001;video; Hope is: Wanting to Pull CloudsWILLCHANGE Polke (ASL)  ; <p>The boy in this work was probably inspired by a 15th- or 16th-century German print; he is shown pulling ropesWILLCHANGE perhaps symbolizing his effort to reach for the clouds. To create the backgroundWILLCHANGE Polke stitched together fragments of fabric and dipped the resulting surface in polyester resin. He then poured paint on the back of the work and shifted the canvas to create different shapes. FinallyWILLCHANGE he painted the figure itself. All toldWILLCHANGE this work took Polke a year to complete.</p> 
5189040692001;video; Mountains and SeaWILLCHANGE Frankenthaler (ASL)  ; <p>This work is a perfect example of Frankenthaler’s technique of making pictures entirely by &quot;stainingWILLCHANGE&quot; a process in which she poured thinned paint onto rawWILLCHANGE unprimed canvas. This method results in fields of transparent color that seem to float in spaceWILLCHANGE with the weave of the canvas establishing the flatness of the image. Her arrangement of colors and shapes often evoke the natural environmentWILLCHANGE and each work creates a unique visual space and atmosphere.</p> 
5189044194001;video; Piano mÃ©caniqueWILLCHANGE Mitchell (ASL)  ; <p>Mitchell was a leading figure in the group of artists known as the second generation of abstract expressionists. In this paintingWILLCHANGE the boldWILLCHANGE animated lines against a white ground capture Mitchell’s spontaneous and impulsive painting method. She often drew upon childhood memories of Lake Michigan when composing paintingsWILLCHANGE some of which she called “expressionist landscapes.” Because they are totally abstractWILLCHANGE the viewer is invited to connect to her works on an emotional level.</p> 
5189044200001;video; FaÃ§ades d’immeubles (Building FaÃ§ades)WILLCHANGE Dubuffet (ASL)  ; <p>The rough textureWILLCHANGE somber color paletteWILLCHANGE and coarse style of Dubuffet’s paintings confront the viewer with their directness. In this workWILLCHANGE he depicts a city in a graffiti-like figurative style. He created the animatedWILLCHANGE crudely drawn stick figures of this postwar apartment complex by scratching through black paint to reveal hiddenWILLCHANGE delicate colors beneath.</p> 
5189044201001;video; Tableau No. IV; Lozenge Composition with RedWILLCHANGE GrayWILLCHANGE BlueWILLCHANGE YellowWILLCHANGE and BlackWILLCHANGE Mondrian (ASL)  ; <p>Though totally abstractWILLCHANGE Mondrian’s “neo-plastic” paintings attempt to capture the complex equilibrium found in nature. The reduced color palette and stark opposition of black vertical and horizontal lines against blocks of white and primary colors were meant to spiritually represent natural harmony. This was the first neo-plastic painting to be created in the lozengeWILLCHANGE or diamondWILLCHANGE format.</p> 
5189044207001;video; Improvisation 31 (Sea Battle)WILLCHANGE Kandinsky (ASL)  ; <p>Kandinsky created dozens of compositions he called “improvisations” from 1909 to 1913. In this workWILLCHANGE strong black lines and scrubbed patches of color course across the canvasWILLCHANGE but their movement is constrained by a monumental triangular composition. The use of the term “improvisation” suggests spontaneous expressionWILLCHANGE while “sea battle” evokes a military engagement.</p> 
5189044236001;video; Great AmericaWILLCHANGE Marshall (ASL)  ; <p>This painting reimagines a boat ride into a haunted tunnel at an amusement park as the Middle Passage—the forced journey of slaves from Africa to the Americas. What might in other hands be a work of heavy irony becomes instead a delicate interweaving of the histories of painting and race. The canvasWILLCHANGE which is stretched directly onto the wallWILLCHANGE creates a screen or backdrop onto which viewers project their own associations triggered by the powerful imagery.</p> 
5189048833001;video; Ground SwellWILLCHANGE Hopper (ASL)  ; <p>Hopper painted this work in South TruroWILLCHANGE MassachusettsWILLCHANGE where he and his wife had built a home and studio in 1934. Despite its bright palette and seemingly serene subjectWILLCHANGE <i>Ground Swell</i> echoes the themes of loneliness and escape typical of Hopper’s oeuvre. The blue skyWILLCHANGE sun-kissed figuresWILLCHANGE and vast rolling water strike a calm note; howeverWILLCHANGE the visible disengagement of the figures from each other and their noticeable preoccupation with the bell buoy at the center of the canvas belie the initial sense of serenity.</p> 
5189049227001;video; Look MickeyWILLCHANGE Lichtenstein (ASL)  ; <p>This painting was the first for which Lichtenstein borrowed an image directly from popular culture: a children’s book called <i>Donald Duck: Lost and Found</i>. He began this work by making a sketch from his source and then recomposing the image for narrative and formal purposes. He traced the drawing onto a canvasWILLCHANGE making more adjustmentsWILLCHANGE and then painted the dots using a perforated metal screen as a stencilWILLCHANGE imitating industrial printing techniques. Lichtenstein would later refer to this work as his first pop art painting.</p> 
5189049243001;video; No More PlayWILLCHANGE Giacometti (ASL)  ; <p>One of the great surrealist sculptorsWILLCHANGE Giacometti often incorporated themes of games and play into his early workWILLCHANGE as with this piece. The form the artist uses here resembles a board game with moveable piecesWILLCHANGE yet the nature of the game is unclear. The ambiguous space and unknowable rules of the “game” represented in <i>No More Play</i> make this piece feel like an object one might encounter in a dream.</p> 
5189049245001;video; Two Girls under an UmbrellaWILLCHANGE Kirchner (ASL)  ; <p>This work dates to early in Kirchner’s prolific careerWILLCHANGE when he was a founding member of the expressionist group called Die BrÃ¼ckeWILLCHANGE or The BridgeWILLCHANGE in Dresden in 1905. In this paintingWILLCHANGE Kirchner has depicted two nudes in a natural settingWILLCHANGE rather than in the contrived space of an academic studio. This work is also an example of the artist’s use of boldWILLCHANGE often crudeWILLCHANGE forms and vibrant color.&nbsp;</p> 
5189049248001;video; Open WindowWILLCHANGE CollioureWILLCHANGE Matisse (ASL)  ; <p>Matisse’s work as a fauvist painter was one phase in a lifelong engagement with color. This small but explosive work is celebrated as one of the most important early paintings of the fauve schoolWILLCHANGE a style distinguished by a startling palette of saturatedWILLCHANGE unmixed colors and broad brushstrokes. This work was painted in CollioureWILLCHANGE a small town on the Mediterranean coast of FranceWILLCHANGE to which Matisse traveled in the summer of 1905 with AndrÃ© DerainWILLCHANGE a fellow fauvist painter.</p> 
5189049249001;audio; Charing Cross BridgeWILLCHANGE LondonWILLCHANGE Derain (ASL)  ; <p>This work is typical of the Fauvist styleWILLCHANGE which Derain developed alongside Henri MatisseWILLCHANGE featuring vibrant and unblended colors. This scene was painted when Derain visited London and captured similar subjects to those Monet had famously painted just a few years previouslyWILLCHANGE though Derain’s color palette and perspective on the scenes contrast sharply with the impressionist master’s work.</p> 
5189049252001;video; Jack-in-the-Pulpit No. IVWILLCHANGE O’Keeffe (ASL)  ; <p>O’KeeffeWILLCHANGE an important artist in the development of American modernismWILLCHANGE is best known today for her abstracted representations of flowers. This painting is one of a series of six depictions of jack-in-the-pulpit flowersWILLCHANGE which the artist would have found near her husband’s family estate in Lake GeorgeWILLCHANGE New York. Each painting in the series zooms in closer to the center of the flower and becomes more abstract.</p> 
5189053067001;video; Family of SaltimbanquesWILLCHANGE Picasso (ASL)  ; <p>This painting shows a group of itinerantWILLCHANGE socially marginalized circus performers who would have traveled from town to town to earn a living. Though the figures in this work stand close to one anotherWILLCHANGE they are emotionally remote. The bleakWILLCHANGE featureless landscape enhances the feeling of isolation and estrangement. This early work could reflect the sympathy Picasso felt for those who shared the transient lifestyle he had experienced in Paris before settling in a ramshackle apartment in Montemarte in 1904WILLCHANGE a year before this was painted.</p> 
5189053071001;video; New YorkWILLCHANGE Bellows (ASL)  ; <p>Bellows became known early in his career for his uncompromising depictions of New York CityWILLCHANGE where he studied art and lived for 20 years until his death in 1925. As a major figure in the Ashcan School of urban realistsWILLCHANGE Bellows’s work captured the raw reality of everyday life in the city. This painting shows the corner of Madison Square at Broadway and Twenty-Third StreetWILLCHANGE which was notorious for its glut of advertising signsWILLCHANGE including the city’s first electric sign.</p>

The theme of these works is courtship menaced by the potential for calamity. Male suitors climb ladders in an attempt to procure flowers for their female love interests or cling to tree branches while trying to secure a token of their affection in the form of a bird’s nest. No less than his contemporaneous views of Paris—evocations of a city vacillating between prosperity and ruin—Robert’s chronicles of the rise and potential fall of a man in love embody the suspenseful confluence of dread and hope that characterized the prerevolutionary period. As Dubin arguesWILLCHANGE it is no accident that in such a climateWILLCHANGE Robert would take up the theme of a lover’s potential mishap: along with the ancient myths of IcarusWILLCHANGE PhaethonWILLCHANGE and others who fatally believed they could defy the force of gravityWILLCHANGE the folly of love furnished eighteenth-century audiences with a shorthand means of coming to terms with the dawning ethereality—the maniasWILLCHANGE fadsWILLCHANGE and bubbles—of modern existence.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
