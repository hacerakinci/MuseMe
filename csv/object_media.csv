Though the figures in this work stand close to one anotherWILLCHANGE they are emotionally remote. The bleakWILLCHANGE featureless landscape enhances the feeling of isolation and estrangement.

Mellon ProfessorWILLCHANGE Center for Advanced Study in the Visual ArtsWILLCHANGE National Gallery of Art. The Tuscan sculptor Francesco Mochi (1580-1654) has long been viewed as an early innovator of the baroque style whose career was eclipsed by his brilliant younger contemporary Gianlorenzo Bernini. But for his 17th-century biographerWILLCHANGE what distinguished Mochi’s sculpture was his determination to adhere to “the Florentine manner.” Estelle Lingo’s new bookWILLCHANGE <i>Mochi’s Edge and Bernini’s Baroque</i>WILLCHANGE argues that the religious and political climate of the later 16th century posed specific challenges for the medium of sculptureWILLCHANGE particularly as it had been practiced by Florentine sculptorsWILLCHANGE most famously Michelangelo. In this lecture held on April 29WILLCHANGE 2018WILLCHANGE Lingo explores how Mochi’s distinctive sculptural style emerged directly from his attempt to carry forward this 16th-century Florentine tradition and to adapt it to the exigencies of a new era. Mochi’s ambitious undertaking produced some of the century’s most breathtaking and technically sophisticated sculpturesWILLCHANGE but its inherent tensions also offer new ways of understanding the formation and rise to dominance of Bernini’s mature sculptural style.</p>

Premiered November 10WILLCHANGE 2013 in the National Gallery of Art East Building Atrium. The conceptual framework of HABITAT involves a percussionist operating comfortably within the domain of his instrumentsWILLCHANGE emerging over the course of his performance into a largerWILLCHANGE more profound environment through his roles as a performer and activator of the technology. This involves his movement to and performance within a “spiral galaxy” of unique percussion stationsWILLCHANGE distributed throughout the performance space. As the percussionist moves through the space on his transformational journeyWILLCHANGE a multiplicity of effects—visualWILLCHANGE auralWILLCHANGE and architectural—enters into the complex formula that comprises the performance of HABITAT. Used uniquely in the Gallery premiere as one of the percussion stationsWILLCHANGE Harry Bertoia’s <i>Tonal Sculpture </i>(1977) is a gift to the Gallery’s permanent collection from Bernard and Audrey Berman. HABITAT stems from the tradition of intermedia artWILLCHANGE in which a variety of media are employed for the mutual benefit of underlying concepts.

3578128619001;video;Wyeth Lecture in American Art 2013: Reversing American Art; <p>In this lecture originally presented on November 20WILLCHANGE 2013WILLCHANGE speaker Jennifer L. Roberts of Harvard University explores one of the fundamental operations of printmaking—reversal—in order to trace its impact on American art across a spectrum of media. Behind every print lies a matrix (from the Latin for mother): a plate or block or stone or screen from which the print has been &quot;pulled.&quot; And in most printing processesWILLCHANGE the final print is a reversed version of the matrix. Although reversal may seem at first to be a simple geometrical switching operationWILLCHANGE its material and philosophical complexity is profound; indeedWILLCHANGE one may posit a kind of &quot;negative intelligence&quot; that informs any work of art that deploys reversal. To focus on reversal is to open up new ways of thinking about connections among the fineWILLCHANGE decorativeWILLCHANGE and industrial arts in AmericaWILLCHANGE not least because so many prominent American artists from the 18th through the 20th century had backgrounds in print and printmaking. &quot;Apprenticed as an engraver&quot;; &quot;trained as a lithographer&quot;; &quot;found initial success as a commercial artist&quot;: such are the typical preludes of American artists' biographies. A rigorous analysis of reversal offers an opportunity to expand the adventure of print from the preludes into the main narratives of the stories we tell about American art. The lecture addresses reversal in several contextsWILLCHANGE from the nature prints of Joseph Breintnall in the 1730s to the handprints of Jasper Johns in the 1960sWILLCHANGE with a core focus on the later 19th century in the work of James McNeill Whistler and the American trompe-l'oeil painters.</p>

4161145705001;video;Vasari's Lives of Piero di Cosimo and the Limits of a Teleological System; <p>Giorgio Vasari wrote two biographies of the Florentine painter Piero di Cosimo: the text published in the second edition of his&nbsp;<i>Lives of the Most Eminent PaintersWILLCHANGE SculptorsWILLCHANGE and Architects</i> in 1568 is a much-revised version of the firstWILLCHANGE printed in 1550. Both works are profoundly teleologicalWILLCHANGE since they are both based on a misleading notion of artistic progress: the first culminating in the figure of MichelangeloWILLCHANGE who mastered all three major artsWILLCHANGE and the second ending with the eulogy of the Accademia del DisegnoWILLCHANGE recently founded (1563) under the political auspices of Duke Cosimo I de’ Medici.

4232527458001;video; Ginevra de’ BenciWILLCHANGE Da Vinci  (ASL)  ; <p>Leonardo’s subtly painted portrait of Ginevra de’ Benci was probably commissioned on the occasion of her engagement at age 16 to Luigi Niccolini. A motto painted on the reverse—VIRTUTEM FORMA DECORAT (“Beauty adorns virtue”)—suggests that the young woman’s chastity was as pristine as her flawless complexion.</p> 
4232527462001;video; The Alba MadonnaWILLCHANGE Raphael (ASL)  ; <p>The round format of this paintingWILLCHANGE called a <i>tondo</i>WILLCHANGE was popular in FlorenceWILLCHANGE where Raphael lived and learned from fellow masters like Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo from 1504 to 1508.

4232538457001;video; Self-PortraitWILLCHANGE Rembrandt (ASL)  ; <p>Rembrandt paintedWILLCHANGE drewWILLCHANGE and etched dozens of self-portraits over his lifetime. TogetherWILLCHANGE his self-portraits form an extended study of a wide range of human emotions and states of mind.

4232538460001;video; The Old MusicianWILLCHANGE Manet (ASL)  ; <p>Manet’s tableau reflects on the isolated nature of modern life in this depiction of a group of disparate people.

4232562787001;video; Self-PortraitWILLCHANGE Van Gogh (ASL)  ; <p>Van Gogh created at least 36 self-portraits. This was one of the last he completed in his decade-long career and the first he painted after suffering a severe breakdown in 1889. Van Gogh shows himself holding his painting tools.

The artist ensured a good view of his subject by renting a second-story room in the hotel across the street from the church as a temporary studio. Throughout the dayWILLCHANGE he studied the effects of light and shade on the faÃ§ade and captured them on canvas. Though these look like they might have been painted quicklyWILLCHANGE conservators have discovered that the paint dried in between layersWILLCHANGE which means that Monet worked on the canvases slowlyWILLCHANGE over a long period of time.</p> 
4232562791001;video; The Feast of the GodsWILLCHANGE Bellini and Titian (ASL)  ; <p>The only artist to surpass the Renaissance painter Bellini’s reputation in Venice was his pupil and collaborator on this painting: Titian. This lively compositionWILLCHANGE which shows a scene about to erupt with sound and actionWILLCHANGE was painted for Duke Alfonso d’Este and illustrates Ovid’s poem “The Feasts” (<i>Fasti</i>). The Duke’s guests would have delighted in identifying the classical source and untangling the identities of the dozen godsWILLCHANGE goddessesWILLCHANGE and mythological beings.</p> 
4232562792001;video; Daniel in the Lions’ DenWILLCHANGE Rubens  (ASL)  ; <p>This painting illustrates the power of Daniel’s faith to protect him from the restlessWILLCHANGE roaring lions. During the Protestant ReformationWILLCHANGE this biblical tale about the trials of an early Christian martyr was used by the Catholic Church to represent perseverance through persecution. Rubens captures the restrained yet menacing energy of the oversized lions with their dynamic poses and lifelike appearance. The strong upward diagonal created by Daniel’s body and red garment indicate the drama of the moment of Daniel’s salvation as the rock sealing the cavernous prison is rolled away.</p>

4260552119001;video; The Repentant MagdalenWILLCHANGE La Tour (ASL)  ; <p>The artist brings a highly naturalistic style to this depiction of a mystical moment. The dim interiorWILLCHANGE illuminated only by a single candle flameWILLCHANGE echoes the solemnity of Mary Magdalen’s expression.

The skullWILLCHANGE mirrorWILLCHANGE and candle flame symbolize the transience of life and the Magdalen’s rejection of a life of luxury to follow Christ.</p> 
4260552121001;video; LaocoÃ¶nWILLCHANGE El Greco (ASL)  ; <p>This is El Greco’s only painting of a mythological scene. LaocoÃ¶nWILLCHANGE a priest in the city of TroyWILLCHANGE warned his countrymen not to accept the gift of the Trojan horseWILLCHANGE which concealed enemy Greek soldiers. The gods punished him by sending serpents to strangle him and his sons. El Greco set the Greek myth against his adopted Spanish city of ToledoWILLCHANGE which appears in other paintings by the artist. The highly expressive color and energetic brush strokes are also hallmarks of El Greco’s highly individual style.</p>

A portrait of his mistress Joanna Hiffernan posed in an informal housedress with flowing hairWILLCHANGE an impassive expressionWILLCHANGE and standing on a white bearskin rugWILLCHANGE told Victorians perhaps more than they wished to know about Hiffernan’s worldinessWILLCHANGE yet is a tour de force of painted texture and a study of white.</p> 
4260555246001;video; Wivenhoe ParkWILLCHANGE EssexWILLCHANGE Constable (ASL)  ; <p>The big skyWILLCHANGE lush green grovesWILLCHANGE and languidly grazing cows immediately evoke the calm tranquility of a pastoral landscape.

4260555247001;video; The Small CrucifixionWILLCHANGE GrÃ¼newald (ASL)  ; <p>This painting presents GrÃ¼newald’s empathetic portrayal of Christ’s pain and suffering in addition to his triumphs. The dramatic poses of the figures surrounding the crossWILLCHANGE as well as the intense colorsWILLCHANGE emphasize the anguish of the moment. GrÃ¼newald also drew on the biblical accounts of this sceneWILLCHANGE in which Saint Luke described a “darkness over all the earth” at the time of Christ’s passingWILLCHANGE by depicting a scene plunged into darkness by a solar eclipse.</p> 
4260555250001;video; The Marquesa de PontejosWILLCHANGE Goya (ASL)  ; <p>Goya shows the marchesa dressed in the height of fashion with a wasp-waisted corset and the adoption of the “shepherdess” style popularized by Marie Antoinette.

The painting enjoyed immediate popularity when exhibited in the country’s centennial year of 1876. Homer would turn increasingly to painting sea and seaside scenesWILLCHANGE especially around GloucesterWILLCHANGE Massachusetts.</p> 
4260555262001;video; The AnnunciationWILLCHANGE Van Eyck (ASL)  ; <p>The tall narrow format of this painting suggests that this would have been the left wing of a triptych. Van Eyck emphasizes the meaning of the annunciationWILLCHANGE the moment when Mary learns of the impending birth of Christ from the angel GabrielWILLCHANGE by including symbolic references to the Old Testament even as this story marks the start of the New Testament. For exampleWILLCHANGE the floor tiles illustrate the stories of David and Goliath as well as Samson destroying the Philistine temple. Both foreshadow events of Christ’s life and the salvation of humankind.</p> 
4260558280001;video; The Voyage of Life: ManhoodWILLCHANGE Cole (ASL)  ; <p>Cole’s epic four-part series <i>Voyage of Life</i> weaves the theme of the four ages of man with the four seasons and the four times of day.

5189040691001;video; Hope is: Wanting to Pull CloudsWILLCHANGE Polke (ASL)  ; <p>The boy in this work was probably inspired by a 15th- or 16th-century German print; he is shown pulling ropesWILLCHANGE perhaps symbolizing his effort to reach for the clouds. To create the backgroundWILLCHANGE Polke stitched together fragments of fabric and dipped the resulting surface in polyester resin. He then poured paint on the back of the work and shifted the canvas to create different shapes. FinallyWILLCHANGE he painted the figure itself.

5189044236001;video; Great AmericaWILLCHANGE Marshall (ASL)  ; <p>This painting reimagines a boat ride into a haunted tunnel at an amusement park as the Middle Passage—the forced journey of slaves from Africa to the Americas.

The theme of these works is courtship menaced by the potential for calamity. Male suitors climb ladders in an attempt to procure flowers for their female love interests or cling to tree branches while trying to secure a token of their affection in the form of a bird’s nest. No less than his contemporaneous views of Paris—evocations of a city vacillating between prosperity and ruin—Robert’s chronicles of the rise and potential fall of a man in love embody the suspenseful confluence of dread and hope that characterized the prerevolutionary period. As Dubin arguesWILLCHANGE it is no accident that in such a climateWILLCHANGE Robert would take up the theme of a lover’s potential mishap: along with the ancient myths of IcarusWILLCHANGE PhaethonWILLCHANGE and others who fatally believed they could defy the force of gravityWILLCHANGE the folly of love furnished eighteenth-century audiences with a shorthand means of coming to terms with the dawning ethereality—the maniasWILLCHANGE fadsWILLCHANGE and bubbles—of modern existence.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

The Tuscan sculptor Francesco Mochi (1580-1654) has long been viewed as an early innovator of the baroque style whose career was eclipsed by his brilliant younger contemporary Gianlorenzo Bernini. But for his 17th-century biographerWILLCHANGE what distinguished Mochi’s sculpture was his determination to adhere to “the Florentine manner.” Estelle Lingo’s new bookWILLCHANGE <i>Mochi’s Edge and Bernini’s Baroque</i>WILLCHANGE argues that the religious and political climate of the later 16th century posed specific challenges for the medium of sculptureWILLCHANGE particularly as it had been practiced by Florentine sculptorsWILLCHANGE most famously Michelangelo.
