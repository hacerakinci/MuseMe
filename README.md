# MuseMe - Database Management System Project

We have developed an interactive website that allows users to access information about art objects by searching through collections and locations. The website includes a media section containing verbal descriptions, a location section that enables users to virtually explore different rooms, and a constituents section that contains data about the object creators, donors, and other relevant individuals. Our aim is to provide a comprehensive and engaging web gallery experience. Users will have the ability to add, edit, or delete content on this collaborative website.
